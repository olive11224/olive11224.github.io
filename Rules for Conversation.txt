Rules for constructive conversation:

1. Don't assume the opposing party is very stupid. If they say something that you interpret instinctively as self-contradictory, chew on it for a second before you assume they don't know what they're talking about. Don't assume that they need to review elementary definitions that conversation about the topic cannot occur without. 

2. Be ready to imagine that the other party holds views different to your own, and the consequences of these differences. Propositions don't live in a vacuum: they entail other propositions.

3. Consider tacit assumptions the other party may be making. Be ready to agree with some of them! Otherwise, you will either spend time quibbling about common ground (besides the point) or talking past each other.

4. Don't be dogmatic about rules of conversation. If you have cause to disregard previous rules, use your brain.
