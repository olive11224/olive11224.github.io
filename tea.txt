You may have seen maps floating around the internet documenting the words
for tea in various world languages. Immediately, most of them can be sorted
into two categories on the basis of their initial consonant: those that
begin with /t/ and those that beging with a sibilant like /ts/ or /tʃ/ or /ʃ/.

The two different initial consonants reflect two different origins. The 
former is ultimately rooted in Hokkien, the language of a seafaring people
coming from the southeastern coast of China, across the strait from Taiwan,
and the latter is rooted in Mandarin, the language of government of late 
imperial history and of the common people of much of northern and 
southwestern China.

The story goes that the language of origin reflects two different trade 
routes. If the origin is Hokkien, then the word likely travelled with 
Hokkien speakers to Southeast Asia, whence it was picked up and spread by
the European colonial powers, whereas if the origin is Mandarin, then it
likely spread through the silk road.

One note for Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean: the languages of some of the
countries bordering China. These countries, having been influenced culturally
by China throughout history, systematically borrowed Chinese vocabulary 
at different points in the first millenium, and it is this layer of Chinese
that their languages' words for tea are rooted in.

There are a couple exceptions to this rule, which I will deal with here.

1) The Portuguese word for tea is 'chá' /ʃa/, distinguishing it from the rest
of western Europe. This is said to come from Cantonese, but the place of 
articulation of the initial consonant is strange to me; Cantonese has 
a nonpalatalized /ts/ there. On the other hand, it would make sense
historically: Portugal maintained for a very long time the colony of 
Macao - in Cantonese speaking territory.

2) The Polish word for tea is 'herbata' /xɛrbata/. The first element 
comes transparently from Latin 'herba', and the second element from Hokkien.

3) This is the interesting one. The Burmese word for tea is 'လက်ဖက်',
transliterated 'lahpek' and pronounced /ləpʰɛʔ/,
which is not derivable in any part from a Chinese language. 

What does this mean?

Actually, if these language mapmakers were more precise in their documentation,
they would have noticed a whole diversity of words for tea around the mountains
of northern Southeast Asia.

Here I list a handful:

Jingpo (Kachin) - 'hpa-lap' https://archive.org/details/dli.pahar.3005/page/535/mode/1up /pʰalap/ https://kachinportal.aa-ken.jp/en/languages/#jinghpaw
Ngochang (Achang) - 'huh-khyvp'  /huhkʰjaˑp/ https://www.academia.edu/7152888/A_preliminary_Ngochang_Kachin_English_Lexicon
Shan - 'ၼမ်ႉၼဵင်ႈ' - 'nam-neng' /nam˦˨ˀ.neŋ˧˧˨/ https://glosbe.com/en/shn/tea (first part means water, so probably second syllable means tea)

Others may be found in van Driem's seminal book, Tale of Tea.

At any rate, this amount of diversity helps paint a picture of the plant: it was originally cultivated in mountainous Southeast Asia. It spread to 
China at some point, from which it proliferated to the rest of the world through the pathways mentioned above.

Interestingly, the Southeast Asians who cultivated tea originally didn't use the plant for a beverage, as is customary in the Chinese tradition. Rather, they
ferment tea leaves and use them as a vegetable. 

If you are familiar with Burmese Cuisine, you are probably aware of this custom.

Questions now remain:

1) When did tea first make its way to China?
2) When was tea first steeped into a beverage?
3) What happened from then on?

And this is what will inform the structure of the remainder of the article.
