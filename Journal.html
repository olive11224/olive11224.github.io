<h2>Flora</h2>
<p>Today I saw a purple flower with five petals. It was a very low lying, non-woody plant. I imagine that some people think of them as weeds, which is a shame because they are awfully pretty.</p>

<p> I also went with a friend up to the edge of Strawberry Creek and mucked around for a bit. The bank is quite overgrown with bramble and ivy, so at first it seems inaccessible. 
But, there are paths that cut past all the vegetation to get up close to the stream. The water is unusually clear for today's rainy weather, as usually the rain washes sediment into the creek. 
What does persist in the water, unfortunately, is the hideous amount of trash. I feel that the people of this state should learn to respect the environment more. </p>

<p> Many of the flowers I came across today are quite fragrant. However, excepting cheesewood, most of their scents are similar and one dimensional. They are powdery and do very little to stimulate my olfactory cells in an interesting 
way.</p>

<h2>Logic</h2>
<p>Last semester, I took an introductory course to (first order) logic. The crowning results of the class were the soundness and completeness theorems for first order logic.</p>


<p>Recall that a first order logic is a language with the power to write down predicates. 
When we think about what the meanings of formulas in first order logic are, we are interpreting these syntactic objects relative to a particular model.
A model is a commonly understood mathematical object that imbues meanings to the symbols used in the first order logic.</p>

<p>Moreover, we set up in class a formal proof system. We have a list of valid axioms; that is, a set of formulas that are true in any model (under any variable assignment). 
This is distinguished from the set of axioms we employ in a particular mathematical setting.
We then have a number of rules that allow us to get from one finite set of formulas to another. 
In the system we had in class, this was just Modus Ponens; all other information was baked instead into the axioms.</p>

<p>Then, the soundness theorem says: 'if you can prove one formula from a set of formulas, then that set of formulas logically implies that one formula.' 
In particular, if you can prove a formula from the axioms, it is valid.<br>

The completeness theorem says: 'if a set of formulas logically implies a formula, then you can prove the latter from the former.'<br>

How nice!</p>

<p>I saw a Mathoverflow post a couple days ago where some logicians discussed the possibility of ZFC being consistent, but unsound. ZFC is generated by a set of sentences. 
What we mean by ZFC being unsound, then, is that some of what we can prove using ZFC might be false of our naive conception of set theory. 
As our deductive system is sound, this would mean that some of the ZFC axioms fail to reflect our naive conception of set theory.

This does not mean that ZFC is inconsistent; it might just not be applicable to our naive conception of set theory.</p>

<p>My problem with this is that we don't have a rigorous characterization of what our naive conception of set theory is! Wasn't this the motivation for formalizing things in 1st order logic in the first place?
To rigorously characterize our naive conception of set theory? I do not see how this problem is well posed.
</p>

<p>Ah, I see the issue now. The post discussed specifically whether or not ZFC would not apply to our notion of the natural numbers. 
Perhaps the natural numbers are still a naive, fuzzy thing; however, we do have intuitions about the truth/falsity of statements regarding them. That is slightly more palatable.</p>

<h2>Euclidean Geometry</h2>
<p>It is turning out that Euclid, although he only explicitly regards five propositions in his <i>Elements</i> to be axioms, relies on a whole series of implied truths to write his results.
First, let me list Euclid's original axioms: 
<ul>
<li>For each pair of points, there is a unique line that passes through them. </li>
<li>Given segments AB, CD, there is a point E such that B is between A and E and BE is congruent to CD. </li>
<li>Given a point A and a segment AB, there is a circle with center A and radius AB. </li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Philsophy of Science</h2>
<p>I read an excerpt from a book about the philosophy of science today. </p>

<p> Its first topic was the demarcation between science and non-science. One criterion philosophers have used to do so is <it>verificationism</it>.
Given a theory, we of course have an account of what observations follow logically from it. On the other hand, for a theory to be scientific, 
we also need an account of what observations would <it>falsify</it> it. 
In order to judge two competing theories, we would need to find an observable state-of-affairs which is deduced by one but whose negation is deduced by the other,
and then design an experiment to see which arises.</p>

<p> A consequence of verificationism is that the meaning of a theory or proposition is exhausted by the observables it logically deduces.
If two theories provide the same observables, then they are logically equivalent. 
The author gives the example of a hypothetical theistic account of a phenomenon begetting the same observables as an atheistic account, 
and hence the two being equivalent under this notion. I question this example. Theistic accounts are typically rather simple; something exists because
a causer brought it about. However, this predicts precious few observables, about, for instance, characteristics of a phenomenon. 

<p> Take the example of lightning: the idea that Zeus hurls them at the ground predicts the existence of lightning, but not much more. 
Why does lightning occur in storms? Why does it precede thunder? Why does lightning spark fire? Why does lightning damage in the way that it does?
Why does lightning show a preference for hitting certain targets? Why does hair rise before lightning strikes? 
A theistic account can be assembled post-hoc to justify some of these phenomena, but it can never make novel predictions. 
I get the allure of the example being provocative, but come on.</p>

<p> The author then contemplates the status of unobservables in scientific theories. 
Personally, I find the notion that something is observable if and only if it is perceptible to the common human senses arbitrary. 
There is still a mediating instrument in this case! 
They are undoubtedly primary instruments, but you nonetheless do not get a holistic conception of an object beamed into your brain from sensory input.
The distinction drawn between things that are perceived immediately, 
and things that are perceived vis-a-vis technical instruments like microscopes or electrophotometers or Geiger counters, is not interesting.</p>

<p> Someone may object to the observation of theory-internal constructs. After all, scientific models have changed very frequently in the past. 
But on the other hand, I would like to point out that even intuitively differentiated things are not intrinsically so.</p>

<p> Can we not fathom some outside observer looking down at earth and seeing none of the individual organisms, the individual plants and animals and bacteria,
but rather just writing off the entire thing as a homogenous mass of carbon? I do not think it so strange to assume, when working inside a scientific program,
that evidence gathered in this manner counts as observing an object, while also happily admitting that, should the program be </p>

<p> Of course, this should not allow us to post-hoc rationalize experiments as observing a particular theoretic entity. 
What should constitute an attribute of the entity should be given by the theory beforehand. </p>

<h2>Math Pedagogy</h2>
<p>Trying to teach people math is a good way for me to structure my knowledge about the subject. 
While just learning the material for the first time, the theorems I encounter often seem like an uncoordinated jumble of facts, 
with little intuitive connections between them. 
Sure, I can follow my nose through a proof, but I have no sense of what conceit underlies the subject, or why we should care about it.
This becomes clearer when I am forced to present to others. This even holds for things you might think trivial, like grade school arithmetic.

At its core, the purposes of axioms in math is to sharpen an intuitive concept. Take for instance the example of arithmetic: 
we already have an idea of what we want to happen, so now we just need to provide a formal scaffolding for it. 
On the other hand, as you progress farther in math, you typically do not have such an intuition for why what you are doing is meaningful.
Building up this intuition while simultaneously presenting the mathematics rigorously is the difficult part of teaching. </p>

<p> I have thus far written a chapter on Arithmetic for the perspective of someone with no background in math whatsoever. 
As such, I have the formidable task of both motivating the topic from scratch, as well as presenting it rigorously. 
In its current state, it is written with a very laid back, conversational tone, 
and I am concerned that this voice might cloud or gloss over facts I want to say explicitly. </p>

<p> What should I have touched on? First, I look at the natural numbers. 
I take as fact that our process for adding things is well defined and has the properties that we expect of it. 
I hope that it has come across that we are doing this on faith. Indeed, we can reduce addition to recursion on the successor operation 
and give a set theoretic characterization of natural numbers, but that digression would be unmeaningful right now. </p>

<p> We can then motivate multiplication as repeated addition. Here, I think introducing the formal definition recursively is less bad, 
as it basically mimicks how we think of the operation intuitively anyway. 
That the nice algebraic properties of multiplication then follow is not totally clear from the formalism, 
so perhaps an intuitive explanation would be in order. 
Moreover, as an introduction to mathematics itself, expecting the reader to write proofs by inductions from the get-go is both intimidating and uneducational. </p>

<h2> Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems</h2>
<p> How useful is it to know that a set is effectively enumerable? Recall that a set is effectively enumerable if it is either empty, 
or there is a computable, surjective function from the natural numbers onto it. Just knowing that a set is effectively enumerable, 
I am not sure that it is possible to tell which of the two kinds it is. </p>

<p> Given that a set is decidable, it is enumerable. Recall that a set is decidable if its characteristic function is computable. </p>

<p> Decidability implies effective enumerability. However, it is not clear to me that, given that a set is decidable, 
we can show in what sense it is effectively enumerable. Suppose we have the empty set, 
but it is given by a formula that does not obviously tell you that it begets the empty set. Then what? Is this not important? </p>

<p> In Peter Smith's book, he jointly treats a formal language as well as an interpretation with respect to the natural numbers. </p>

<p> He defines a formal language to be sufficiently expressive if it can express every effectively computable one-place function, 
and it can form formulas which quantify over numbers. The former criterion requires us to have some function and constant symbols, but how many, precisely? 
The latter just requires quantifiers. </p>

<p> The set of truths of a sufficiently expressive language is not effectively enumerable. </p>
