<h1>Journal</h1>
<p> 
	<a href="Journal.html">My journal.</a> I muse here about whatever comes to mind. 
	I am proud to say that this includes a variety of topics:
	Chinese history and culture, flora and fauna, linguistics, books I am reading about at the moment (and this last point is itself quite
	diverse). 
	I hope you can find something interesting enough to hold your attention, even while my prose is still in development. 
	One of my main objectives in maintaining this journal is to get better at communicating effectively, as taking four years of STEM classes
	has unfortunately eroded my abilities. 
	You will have noticed from this very paragraph that my writing is uncomfortably choppy and formulaic, for instance. 
</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>

	I list here some things I have accomplished or am in the process of accomplishing.
