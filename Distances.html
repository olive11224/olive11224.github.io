		I don't really get outside much, nor do I really do things. I therefore lack an intuition for both lengths and distances, metric or imperial. 
		While I could get away being clueless in America due to my not being from here, I can't fool myself.
		<h1>Lengths</h1>
		<ul>
			<li> Pocket flashlight - 7 cm

			The length of Japan surprises me. In my head it's always a bit longer than Korea, and because Korea is a plump fellow, the areas would roughly
			balance out. Japan will probably be a little larger, but... it's actually significantly longer and larger than I expected.

			Beijing to Shenzhen is intuitively to me one of the longest vertical distances in China. I thought that it would easily beat the length of Japan,
			and I was sorely mistaken.
