What is our infrastructure made of?

What are our buildings made of? What are our roads paved with? 

As humans in this country (and I think it's probably to say, in this age, in all (!) countries), we interact with things like buildings and 
roads daily. I think you would struggle to find a single person who doesn't do so. 

So what are these things made of?

Houses

Houses in the United States are, if their reputation amongst Europeans is to be believed, uniquely flimsy. Why is that? What have they been made of?
What are they made of now?
