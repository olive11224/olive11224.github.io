A contingent of terminally online leftists I am well acquainted reject the idea of voting for Kamala or Trump. They want to vote third party, instead. 

Many democrats bristle at such people. One common argument against voting third party is as follows: 

"Only two candidates may possibly win. They both suck, yes, but these are the only feasible candidates to vote for. One of these candidates is much worse than the other, so you have a duty to ensure that the less-bad one wins." (harm-reduction)

Those wanting to vote third party have arguments of their own.

One begrudgingly accepts the inevitability of two-party politics:

"Voting third party tells the two parties that you find the third party's platform more appealing. The two parties have an incentive to incorporate third party policies in order to get your vote. This will drive more substantive change than voting for one of the two parties, which will lull them into complacency."

Another does not:

"The two party system is fundamentally undemocratic, because party positions get diluted to what is acceptable to a large, politically diverse group of people. This neuters specific political positions. The only recourse to overturning a two party system is by ... supporting other political parties."

What third party voters agree on is that this election's winner will be either Harris or Trump; that is beside the point. Or is it beside the point? Harris supporters need to convince third party voters that the need to prevent Trump from getting a second term is urgent enough to override their arguments. Third party voters are idealistic (overturning the two party system, hah!) or focused on goals too long-term or dilute to challenge the urgency of preventing Trump from being in office.

Hence the question: Is Trump really so dangerous?

There are two obvious things to look at: 1) Trump's previous term, 2) Trump's policy positions. The second could be given less weight, as Trump is so capricious that it is difficult to link his words with what he will do. The first, however, is better evidence to predict his future actions. 

So what has happened under his first term?

- Redacting the individual mandate from the ACA
- Moderate tax cuts for people across the board, incl. for the highest income bracket (500k+) (2017)
- Appoint 3 conservative supreme court justices
- Partial repeal of Dodd-Frank (2018)
- Covid Response
- Border policy
- NAFTA update
- Increase of deficit
- Foreign policy vis a vis Russia, Middle East
- January 6th

His healthcare policy has not been successful.
