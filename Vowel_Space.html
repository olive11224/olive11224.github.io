			Prerequisite Phonology
		</h1>
		<p>
			Vowels can pretty much be acoustically identifiable based on the proportions between the  major frequencies, or <strong>formants</strong> they exhibit. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The lowest frequency represented is called the <strong>fundamental frequency</strong> and is notated <strong>F0</strong>; however, it is not itself considered a formant.
		</p>
		<p>
			The formants are then notated <strong>Fn</strong> in order of increasing frequency.
		</p>
		<p>
			While they are not themselves sufficient to characterize a vowel for the purpose of human language, the first two formants <strong>F1</strong> and <strong>F2</strong>
			are typically considered the most important ones (with further importance decreasing as the pitch increases). 
			One reason is that they correlate with parameters of articulation: 
			<strong>F1</strong> correlates negatively with the height of the point of the tongue where the point of restriction takes place (or height, for short),
			and <strong>F2</strong> correlates positively with the frontness of the point of the tongue where restriction takes place (or frontness, for short).

			gives one account for why this is. The linked powerpoint also describes Perturbation Theory, an alternative model.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to visually bring the graph in line with conventional depictions of the vowel space, <strong>F1</strong> is assigned the Y-Axis, <strong>F2</strong> the X-Axis,
			and both are flipped.

			Methodology
		</h1>
		<p>
			Much of this is adapted from <a href="http://martinschweinberger.de/docs/articles/PersVowelchartPraat.pdf">here</a>.

		<h2>
			Recording vowels.
		</h2>
		<p>
			The goal is to get a WAV file of your vowels in a controlled environment. 
			Any recording software is therefore usable, but since we are going to use Praat shortly, you might as well stick with it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It is preferrable that your vowels occur in a controlled environment. That is, the ambient sounds should be held constant when you vary the vowel.
			Of course, the characteristics you hold constant should vary accordingly with the target of your experiment.
		</p>
		<p>
			The linked document above recommends the environment /h_d/, as real words are available with most choices of vowels. 
			Most, but unfortunately not <em>all</em>. Recognizing /hawd/ as a word requires some mental gymnastics. 
			Nonetheless, this is the best environment that I am aware of at the moment; if you think of a better one, please tell me.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here comes the fun part: the recording. Record each word once, and save the recording as a .WAV file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that I start to deviate from the method described in the linked document, now. That guide is good if you are fairly confident that your vowels 
			are monophthongal. This is not the case for a lot of vowels in (my) English, unfortunately.
			Instead, I would like to plot the changes in my formants over the course of the vowel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Luckily, Praat can facilitate this. 
			<ol>
				<li> Open your file in Praat and click on 'View & Edit' from the menu on the right.
				<img src = "Praat open.png" alt="Right side, second from the top" width = "300" height = "150">
				<li> Zoom onto a token of your choice and confirm that formant tracking is on. It should look something like this.
				<img src = "Formant view.png" alt = "Formant bands are clearly visible." width = "250" height = "300">
				<li> If formant bands are not appearing or are overly wiggly, click on the button <str>Formant</str> circled in the picture above and toggle settings.
				<li> Identify the vowel portion of the token by consistent dark (i.e. high energy) regions in the low-frequency section of the <str>spectrogram</str> (i.e. the lower panel) and highlight it.
				<li> Go to <str>Formant Listlng</str> under the Formant tab to retrieve formants at various points in the vowel. 
				<img src = "Formant listing.png" alt = "Formant>Formant listing" width = "250" height = "300">
				<li> The data should look something like <img src = "Formant data.png" alt = "Table of formants. We only need the first two." width = "250" height = "300">
				<li> Copy and paste the first two columns into a fresh text document (22 entries per column?), and repeat for all remaining tokens. Separate the data for each token with an empty row (but no other text!).
